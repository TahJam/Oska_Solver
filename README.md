# Oska
This program will take a valid Oska board and play the best possible move by doing a limited depth-first search. The user specifies how deep they would like the program to search. After all the possible moves for a given Oska board are generated by the MoveGen() function, the list of boards are evaluated and given a score. The board with the highest score will be chosen as the best next possible move for the current Oska Board.
